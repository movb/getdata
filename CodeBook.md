### Data Transformation Steps

Following data transformations are carried out by the `run_analysis.R` script.

1. For each of the training and test datasets, 
    1. Read the `X` values
    2. Take a subset of the columns representing only the mean and standard deviation values. Subsetting is done early on to conserve memory.
    3. Associate additional columns to represent activity IDs and subject IDs read from `y_<dataset>.txt` and `subject_<dataset>.txt` files respectively.
    4. Assign column names by manipulating the measurement names in `features.txt` to remove spaces and convert them to camel case.
2. Merge the training and the test sets, read as in step 1 to create one data set.
3. Associate an additional column with descriptive activity names as specified in `activity_labels.txt`.
4. Melt the dataset by specifying activity ID, name and subject ID as the only ID variables.
5. Re cast the melted dataset with activity name and subject id as the only IDs and `mean` as the aggregator function.
6. Save the result in re-casted dataset as `tidyset.txt`


### Data Description

The data for this data set was derived from sources mentioned in the "Original data" section of this document.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
